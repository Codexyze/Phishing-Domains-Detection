# 🛡️ Phishing  Domain Detection


Detect and classify phishing domains using machine learning. This repository provides tools, notebooks, and scripts for identifying malicious (phishing) domains based on features extracted from domain names and possibly other metadata. The project is intended for cybersecurity researchers, data scientists, and developers interested in automated phishing detection.

## Overview

**Phishing URL Predictor** is a smart security app designed to help users detect malicious and phishing websites before clicking on them.  
Don't let cyber threats catch you off guard.  
🔍 This app uses **machine learning** to analyze URLs in real-time and determine if they're safe or potentially harmful.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vky6366/Phishing-Domains-Detection.git
   cd Phishing-Domains-Detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Most dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or, if you use JupyterLab/Notebook:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

## Usage

- **Jupyter Notebooks:**  
  Explore the notebooks in this repository to see step-by-step data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  Then open and run the provided notebooks.

- **Python Scripts:**  
  Some features or model training steps may be available as standalone scripts (check the repo for `.py` files). Run them as:
  ```bash
  python script_name.py
  ```

## Data

- Use your own dataset or download publicly available phishing/legitimate domain lists.
- Typical format: CSV with at least columns like `domain` and `label` (`1` for phishing, `0` for legitimate).
- Place your dataset in a `data/` directory or as specified in the notebooks/scripts.

## Model Training

- Follow the instructions in the main notebook(s) to preprocess data, extract features, train models, and evaluate performance.
- You can experiment with different algorithms and feature sets by editing the notebooks.

## Tech Stack

### 🎨 Frontend (Android App)
- **Kotlin**
- **Jetpack Compose** – Modern UI toolkit
- **MVVM Architecture** – Clean and scalable code separation
- **Retrofit** – API communication with Flask backend

### 🧪 Backend
- **Flask (Python)** – Lightweight API server
- **Machine Learning Model** – URL classification for phishing detection
- **RESTful API** – Endpoint to handle URL predictions

## 📲 App Flow

1. **Splash Screen**: Shows app branding.
2. **Home Screen**: User enters a suspicious URL.
3. **Prediction Request**: URL is sent to the Flask backend via Retrofit.
4. **Processing**: ML model evaluates the URL.
5. **Result**: UI shows whether the URL is safe ✅ or unsafe ❌.
6. **Action**: If unsafe, the user can tap **Contact CyberSecurity** for help.
